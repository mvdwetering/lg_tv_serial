# LG TV Serial

Custom integration for Home Assistant to control LG TVs that support the serial control protocol

The protocol is (documented by LG here)[https://www.lg.com/ca_en/support/product-support/troubleshoot/help-library/cs-CT20098005-20153058982994/] (thank you LG for not hiding it like other manufacturers do)

The integration works for me, but the state is a bit wonky when turning on/off the TV since it does not respond to commands for a bit when it is turning on/off.
