# LG TV Serial

Custom integration for Home Assistant to control LG TVs that support the serial control protocol

The protocol is [documented by LG here](https://www.lg.com/ca_en/support/product-support/troubleshoot/help-library/cs-CT20098005-20153058982994/). Kudos for LG for making the protocol specification available.

This is a quickly whipped up integration but seems to work fine for me for a while now (mostly to just turn on/off the TV).

I am unsure for what range of TV models this applies, I have an older model from 2011 which has a DB9 serial connector for this protocol. Check the owners manual of your TV (downloadable from LG website) to see if it supports this protocol.

## Gotchas

It takes a while for the TV to change actual state when turning on/off. This is indicated (a bit hacky) by using the state "Buffering". When state is ON it is safe to send other commands.

Most entities can not be used when the TV is Off, so these entities become unavailable to indicate that.

## Features

Connect through serial or any [URL handler supported by PySerial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/url_handlers.html) this makes it possible to connect through networked tcp-2-serial solutions so your TV does not have to be connected directly to your Home Assistant machine.

### Action for sending raw commands

If there is a need to send commands that are not supported one can use the "lg_tv_serial.send_raw" action. Check the LG documentation for the command formats.

See example below, check out the developer tools in Home Assistant for more details.

```yaml
action: lg_tv_serial.send_raw
target:
  entity_id:
    - media_player.lg_tv

  command1: k
  command2: e

## Configure

Configure the integration as usual.

* Go to Settings > Devices and Services and press Add Integration.
* Search for "LG TV Serial"
* Provide the serial port to which the TV is connected
  * For real serial ports usually something like "/dev/ttyUSB0"
